3. **Simple Auth** - Username/password sufficient for 4 internal users, no OAuth needed
4. **Email Integration** - SMTP with nodemailer for maximum flexibility
5. **QuickBooks OAuth** - Standard OAuth 2.0 flow for security
6. **Audit Everything** - Complete logging for compliance and security

- Report export to PDF/Excel
- Email templates UI (customize email designs)

### Long Term:
- QuickBooks payment sync (bidirectional)
- Scheduled report email delivery
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile responsive improvements
- Customer portal (for company owners)

---
