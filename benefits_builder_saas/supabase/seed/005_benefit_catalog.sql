-- Sample Section 125 Benefit Catalog
-- Note: This is a simplified catalog. Benefits Builder should verify and update with their actual offerings.

-- For this seed, we'll create a benefit_catalog table structure
-- First, let's check if it exists in schema, if not we'll add sample data to employee_benefits

-- Common Section 125 Pre-Tax Benefits:
-- HSA (Health Savings Account) - reduces FIT and FICA
-- FSA (Flexible Spending Account - Health) - reduces FIT and FICA
-- Dependent Care FSA - reduces FIT and FICA
-- Premium Only Plan (POP) - Health Insurance Premiums - reduces FIT and FICA
-- Dental Insurance Premiums - reduces FIT and FICA
-- Vision Insurance Premiums - reduces FIT and FICA
-- Short-term Disability - may reduce FIT only
-- Long-term Disability - may reduce FIT only
-- Group Term Life (up to $50k) - reduces FIT and FICA

-- Note: Since the schema doesn't include a benefit_catalog table yet,
-- this is placeholder documentation. The actual catalog will need to be
-- managed through the admin interface at /admin/catalog
