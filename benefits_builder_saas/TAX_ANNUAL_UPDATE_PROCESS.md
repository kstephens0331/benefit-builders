## Database Migration Template

Create new file: `supabase/seed/008_state_tax_2026.sql`

```sql
-- STATE TAX DATA FOR 2026
-- Updated: December 2025
-- Effective: January 1, 2026

-- Update each state following this pattern:
INSERT INTO tax_state_params (
  state, tax_year, method, flat_rate,
  standard_deduction, personal_exemption, dependent_exemption,
  allowances_method, brackets, credits, locality_mode, effective_from
)
VALUES (
  'CA', 2026, 'brackets', null,
  5500,  -- Updated standard deduction
  155,   -- Updated personal exemption
  450,   -- Updated dependent exemption
  'per_allowance_amount',
  '[
    {"max": 10700, "rate": 0.01, "base": 0},
    -- ... updated brackets
  ]'::jsonb,
  null, 'none', '2026-01-01'
) ON CONFLICT (state, tax_year) DO UPDATE SET
  brackets = EXCLUDED.brackets,
  standard_deduction = EXCLUDED.standard_deduction,
  personal_exemption = EXCLUDED.personal_exemption,
  dependent_exemption = EXCLUDED.dependent_exemption;

-- Repeat for all 50 states + DC
```

## Testing Checklist

After updating tax data:

### 1. Smoke Tests
- [ ] Generate test payroll for each state
- [ ] Compare withholding to official tables
- [ ] Verify edge cases (min wage, max bracket)

### 2. Regression Tests
- [ ] Run existing test suite
- [ ] Verify 2025 data still accessible (for historical records)
- [ ] Check billing calculations

### 3. Production Verification
- [ ] Deploy to staging first
- [ ] Run full billing cycle for January
- [ ] Compare results to December (should be different due to new rates)
- [ ] Get sign-off before production deploy

## Historical Data Retention

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT delete old tax data!

Old data is needed for:
- Historical payroll reports
- Amended returns
- Audits
- Year-end reconciliation

**Best Practice**:
- Keep all tax_year data in database
- Never UPDATE existing year, always INSERT new year
- Archive old seed files for reference

Example query for historical data:
```sql
-- Get 2025 rates
SELECT * FROM tax_state_params WHERE tax_year = 2025;

-- Get 2026 rates
SELECT * FROM tax_state_params WHERE tax_year = 2026;
```

---

## Version Control

Each year's tax data should be:
1. **Committed to git** with clear message
   ```
   git commit -m "Add 2026 state tax withholding data - all 51 jurisdictions"
   ```

2. **Tagged in git**
   ```
   git tag tax-data-2026
   git push origin tax-data-2026
   ```

3. **Documented in changelog**
   ```
   ## [2026.01.10] - Tax Data Update
   - Updated all 50 states + DC to 2026 withholding rates
   - Verified against official state publications
   - Effective date: January 1, 2026
   ```

---

## Compliance & Audit Trail

Maintain documentation showing:
- Source of each state's data (URL, PDF)
- Date data was collected
- Person who verified data
- Testing results
- Deployment date

This protects against:
- IRS audits
- Client disputes
- Legal liability
- Insurance claims

---

## Emergency Mid-Year Updates

Sometimes states change rates mid-year:

**If a state announces mid-year changes:**

1. **Assess Impact**
   - How many clients in that state?
   - When is effective date?
   - Is it retroactive?

2. **Update Database**
   - Create emergency migration
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy ASAP

3. **Notify Clients**
   - Email affected companies
   - Explain rate change
   - Adjust invoices if needed

4. **Document**
   - Why change happened
   - How it was handled
   - Lessons learned

---

## Long-Term Automation (Future Enhancement)

**Potential Future Features:**

1. **API Integration**
   - Subscribe to state tax API services
   - Auto-import new rates
   - Still require manual verification

2. **Change Detection**
   - Monitor state websites
   - Alert when new publications posted
   - Track collection progress

3. **Calculation Verification**
   - Auto-test against official calculators
   - Flag discrepancies
   - Generate test reports

**Vendors to Consider:**
- Symmetry Tax Engine
- ADP Tax Services
- Vertex Tax Technology
- Avalara
