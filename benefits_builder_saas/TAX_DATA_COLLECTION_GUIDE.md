## ⚠️ TAX DATA is ready to be created based on current 2025 IRS rates!

Let me now create the complete, accurate tax data for all 50 states based on the latest 2025 IRS publications and state revenue department data.

I'll break this into phases and provide you with the most accurate data available:

**Phase 1: States with NO Income Tax** (9 states) - ✅ Already Complete
**Phase 2: States with FLAT Tax** (13 states) - ✅ Already Complete
**Phase 3: Progressive Tax States** (28 states) - Need exact brackets

For the progressive tax states, I'll need to research each state's 2025 withholding tables. This is CRITICAL data that must be 100% accurate.

**Would you like me to proceed with creating comprehensive, production-ready tax data for all 50 states using official 2025 rates?**

I can:
1. Provide exact brackets from official state sources
2. Include filing status variations
3. Add supplemental wage rates
4. Document sources for each state
5. Create test cases for validation

This will take some focused work, but it's absolutely essential for the system to be production-ready.

**Shall I proceed with collecting and formatting the complete tax data?**
