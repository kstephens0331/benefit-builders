## 🔥 Critical Fixes Applied

**Fix**: Removed all references
**Impact**: Eliminated runtime errors

### 4. Input Validation (HIGH)
**Problem**: No validation on POST endpoints
**Fix**: Comprehensive Zod schemas
**Impact**: Prevents invalid data, calculation errors

### 5. Database Integrity (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: No constraints on duplicate invoices

## 🎯 Key Metrics Explained

### Profit Margin %
```
Formula: (BB Profit / Employer FICA Savings) × 100
Healthy Range: 60-80%
Example: $1,000 BB profit / $1,300 employer savings = 76.9%
```

### Enrollment Rate
```
Formula: (Enrolled Employees / Total Employees) × 100
Target: 70-90%
Example: 150 enrolled / 200 total = 75%
```

### Avg Revenue per Employee
```
Formula: Monthly Revenue / Enrolled Employees
Benchmark: $15-30/employee (varies by model)
Example: $10,000 revenue / 500 enrolled = $20/employee
```
