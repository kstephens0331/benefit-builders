# Email Notifications Setup Guide

## Overview

Automated email notifications have been integrated into the Benefits Builder system. Emails are sent for:

1. **Welcome Emails** - When a new company is onboarded via bulk upload
2. **Monthly Billing Notifications** - When invoices are generated
3. **Monthly Reports** - Performance summaries for companies (future feature)

---

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get Email Credentials from Bill

You mentioned you'll get a **one-time password** from Bill. This is typically an **App Password** for Gmail or an SMTP password.

**For Gmail:**
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Security â†’ 2-Step Verification (must be enabled)
3. App Passwords â†’ Generate new app password
4. Select "Mail" and "Other" (custom name: "Benefits Builder")
5. Copy the 16-character password

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (SMTP)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@benefitsbuilder.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Benefits Builder
```

**Important Notes:**
- If using Gmail, `EMAIL_USER` should be your Gmail address
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` should be the **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- `EMAIL_FROM` can be any email address (it's the "From" header, not authentication)
- Port 587 uses STARTTLS (recommended), port 465 uses SSL

### Step 3: Deploy Environment Variables to Vercel

```bash
# Add email credentials to Vercel
vercel env add EMAIL_HOST production
# Enter: smtp.gmail.com

vercel env add EMAIL_PORT production
# Enter: 587

vercel env add EMAIL_USER production
# Enter: your_email@gmail.com

vercel env add EMAIL_PASSWORD production
# Enter: your_app_password_here

vercel env add EMAIL_FROM production
# Enter: noreply@benefitsbuilder.com

vercel env add EMAIL_FROM_NAME production
# Enter: Benefits Builder

# Redeploy to apply changes
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test Email System

**Option A: Via API (Requires authentication)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/email/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: bb_session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Option B: Via Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to Settings (future UI)
3. Click "Send Test Email"

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid login"
- Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are correct
- If using Gmail, ensure you're using an **App Password**, not your account password
- Check that 2FA is enabled on Gmail account

### Error: "Connection refused"
- Verify `EMAIL_PORT` is correct (587 for STARTTLS, 465 for SSL)
- Check firewall isn't blocking SMTP connections

### Error: "Self-signed certificate"
- For development only, you can disable TLS verification (NOT recommended for production):
  ```typescript
  transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: EMAIL_HOST,
    port: EMAIL_PORT,
    secure: false,
    auth: { user: EMAIL_USER, pass: EMAIL_PASSWORD },
    tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false } // DEVELOPMENT ONLY
  });
  ```

### Emails Going to Spam
1. **SPF Record**: Add SPF record to your domain DNS
   ```
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
   ```

2. **DKIM**: Configure DKIM signing (requires enterprise email service)

3. **Email Content**: Avoid spam trigger words, include unsubscribe link
